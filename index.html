                <h2>Nice to Meet you,</h2>

                <p>I'm Andrea Risjord, a UX Researcher and Designer. I enjoy understanding 
                    human stores through thorough and empathetic research and applying my 
                    skills to solve human problems with functional and intuitive designs.</p>
                <p>I always thought I would be an Anthropological researcher, but I had a
                     hard time envisioning myself in that world. After graduating with a 
                     Bachelor of Arts in Visual Arts and Anthropology from Emory University, 
                     I fell into the world of art and manufacturing. That experience allowed 
                     me time working in high-pressure team environments, juggling client 
                     expectations, and managing workflow between complex and independent teams. 
                     However, I continued to search for the missing link. I was striving for an 
                     outlet for my constant questions about life as a human being and how we 
                     experience this world.</p>

                <p>In 2022 I was introduced to UX. I had no idea what it was, but the more I 
                    learned, the more I felt like the pieces were finally fitting together for 
                    me. UX research is the perfect combination of research meets design that 
                    I'd been looking for. I decided to pursue a post-graduate certificate in 
                    UX/UI Research and design from UMN which will finish in May of 2023.</p>

                <p>Now, I specialize in problem-finding and solving using functional and beautiful 
                    design. Research is where it all started for me and that is still where I find 
                    joy. Understanding people's stories and communicating their experiences gives 
                    me a feeling of connection to my community and to humankind as a whole while 
                    discovering ways to solve problems scratches my itch for efficiency and order.</p>

                <p>My design aesthetic is influenced by my studies in art history and anthropology, 
                    my musical taste, and various hobbies.</p>
